BirdCheck allows the user to view recent bird sightings in the UK, including maps for each species. It also lets the user keep track of their own sightings and take notes on them.

**Live demo:** [HERE](https://birdcheck.netlify.app/)

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js

The application uses React to handle all user interactions and display data. It fetches bird sightings and images from external APIs (eBird and Flickr) and updates the user interface accordingly to display recent bird sightings in the UK. Interactive maps are rendered with Leaflet to show the locations where birds were spotted. User data is stored in localStorage, ensuring that personal bird lists and notes persist across sessions.

BirdCheck meets W3C validation standards and incorporates accessibility best practices, including ARIA attributes and semantic HTML. It also features clear loading and error states for a smooth and inclusive user experience.
